	<li>Use mouse wheel to zoom-in or zoom-out.</li>
	<li>Click on checkboxes for appropriate actions.</li>
	<li>Right-click on cursor or on scale to enter digital values. You can use:
		<ul>
			<li>Enter integer or floating-point value, i.e.: <b>3.14</b></li>
			<li>Enter degrees using ":", i.e.: <b>2:30:26</b></li>
			<li>Enter pre-defined constants: <b>pi</b>, <b>pi1</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>e1</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>c1</b>, <b>q</b></li>
		</ul>

<h1><a name="Installation"></a><font size="+2">Installation</font></h1>
<blockquote>

No installation necessary.
Just un-zip the downloaded package.
The applications for Windows, Apple OS X and Linux (Ubuntu) are inside.
On Linux you may wish to re-compile the code from the source directory.
</blockquote>


<h1><a name="QuickStart"></a><font size="+2">Quick start</font></h1>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Double click the application to start. The default (or previously loaded) side rule will appear.</li>
<li>Click on the sliding rule and drag it to make it move.</li>
<li>Click on the cursor (or on the stator rule) to move the cursor.</li>
<li>Right-click on any hairline (or on any of the scales) to enter numeric value. The cursor will automatically move to the specified spot.</li>
<li>Left-click on any hairline to enter numeric value. The sliding rule will automatically move to the specified spot under the hairline.</li>
<li>Use the Readouts menu to control where the numeric values are going to appear.</li>
<li>Use the File -> Load menu to load specific slide rule.</li>
<li>... or simply drag-and-drop a text file (containing slide rule definition) onto the emulator.</li>
<li>On some trigonometrical scales values are given in degrees, minutes and fractions of minutes.
Thus, 2.3 will mean: two degrees and thirty minutes (2.5 degree).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h1><a name="Sides"></a><font size="+2">Both sides of the slide rule</font></h1>
<blockquote>
Slide rules often have scales on both sides (front and back).
Sometime scales appear on both sides of the slide only.
This slide rule emulator allows for switching between two sides.
In fact, it makes it possible to have more than just two sides.
<ul>
<li>Every file contining slide rule can have, in fact, several slide rules inside, one after another.</li>
<li>You can switch between each sliderule by pressing function keys (from F1 to F12).</li>
<li>The maximum number of slide rule sides is stored in the "config.txt" file.
Look for the <b>number_of_slide_rules [...]</b> command.</li>
<li>The default maximum number of slide rules is 3. First for the front, second for the back and third for both sides.
The corresponding keys are F1, F2 and F3.</li>
<li>You can make as many side as you like, but you have only 12 function keys. Therefore you won't be able to use more than 12 sides.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h1><a name="Readouts"><font size="+2">Readouts menu</font></a></h1>
<blockquote>
The Readouts menu determines where the numeric values appear.
<ul>
<li>The values can appear on both sides of slides and stators.</li>
<li>The values can appear on the main hairline as well.</li>
<li>The values can also appear on other hairlines.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>


<h1><a name="Length"/><font size="+2">Length menu</font></h1>
<blockquote>
This menu allows you to customise the length of a slide rule.<br/><br/>
Every file with slide rule may in fact specify its own length.
Some of them may be shorter, others can be longer.
However, if you check the "length override" option, then every slide rule will have the same length, which you specify in the menu.<br/><br/>
If you wish to specify the length, which is not available as an option, then you can edit the "config.txt" file directly.
This is highly recommended.
</blockquote>


<h1><a name="Motion"/><font size="+2">Motion menu</font></h1>

<blockquote>
This menu allows you to adjust how slides and cursor respond to the mouse dragging.
Slides and cursor may move slower (settings lower than 1.0), faster (settings higher than 1.0) or at the same speed (setting equal to 1.0).<br/><br/>
Every slide rule can have its own motion multiplier.
Some of them may respond with high resistance, some others may move much faster.
In fact, every single slide on a multi-slide slide rule can have its own multiplier as well.
However, if you check the "motion override" option, then every slide on every slide rule will slide at the same speed.<br/><br/>
If you wish to specify motion multiplier, which is not available as an option, then you can edit the "config.txt" file directly.
This is highly recommended.
</blockquote>

<h1><a name="Animation"/><font size="+2">Animation menu</font></h1>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You can switch the animation ON or OFF.</li>
<li>You can change the number of animation steps.</li>
<li>You can change the delay between animation steps.</li>
<li>You can choose LINEAR animation. By default, slides and cursor accelerate and decelerate. In linear mode, the motion is continuous.</li>
<li>You can also choose VARIABLE SPEED option. By default slides and cursor move at roughly the same speed.
It means that it take longer to go over greater distance.
Variable speed option allows slides and cursor to preserve the amount of time necessary for different distances.</li>
<li>Every slide rule may have its own animation settings.
However, if you check the "animation override" option, then your choices will take precedence.</li>
<li>If you wish to specify animation steps and/or delay frames, which are not available as an option, then you can edit the "config.txt" file directly.
This is highly recommended.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h1><a name="Config"/><font size="+2">Advanced configuration</font></h1>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The "config.txt" file can be edited manually.</li>
<li>You can adjust numeric values, such as length, motion speed, animation steps and animation frames.</li>
<li><b>number_of_slide_rules [ number ]</b> specifies the maximum number of sides of a slide rule.
Default value is <b>3</b>. Practical maximum value is 12 as there are only 12 function keys available (for switching between sides).</li>
<li><b>no_automatic_save []</b> will prevent Slide Rule Emulator from overwriting it. The changes, which you will make using menus will not be permanent.</li>
<li><b>I_made_my_donation []</b> will suppress donation reminder.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h1><a name="MakingYourOwn"/><font size="+2">Making your own slide rule</font></h1>
<blockquote>
<li>Every slide rule is stored in each separate text file.</li>
<li>You can create your own text files containing your own arrangements of scales, colours, sizes, hairlines and so on.</li>
<li>Text files with slide rules contain simple commands.</li>
<li>Perhaps the best idea is to start with an existing slide rule, modify it slightly and save.</li>
<li>Of course, you can build your slide rule starting with an empty file.</li>
<li>Read through the list of commands and list of scales (below).</li>
</blockquote>

<li>Edit the "config.txt" file with a simple text editor. Notepad or gedit will do perfectly well.</li>
<li>Insert an extra line somewhere in the middle. The line should be as follows: "I_made_my_donation []".</li>
